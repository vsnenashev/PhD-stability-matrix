# PhD-stability-matrix
This directory contains my code for FEM to solve stability problem. This includes an algorithm which solves a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.

## Python Scripts

- `main.py`: Python script to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and to find numerically critical moment.
- `Functions.py`: Python script to determine an exact stiffness matrix.

## CSV files
- `I-beam (B) GOST 26020-83.csv`: csv file containing normative stiffnesses of I-beam
- `Nodes.csv`: csv file containing beam nodes characteristics
- `Elements.csv`: csv file containing beam finite elements characteristics
